Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try:\n\n1. **Check the Wi-Fi connection:** Ensure that your doorbell is within range of your Wi-Fi router and that the Wi-Fi signal is strong. You can try moving the doorbell closer to the router or using a Wi-Fi extender to improve the signal strength.\n\n2. **Power cycle the doorbell:** Unplug the doorbell from the power source and wait for 30 seconds. Then, plug it back in and wait for it to restart. This can help reset the doorbell's Wi-Fi connection.\n\n3. **Re-connect the doorbell to Wi-Fi:** Open the Alarm.com app on your smartphone or tablet. Go to the \"Devices\" section and select your video doorbell. Tap on the \"Wi-Fi\" settings and follow the prompts to re-connect the doorbell to your Wi-Fi network.\n\n4. **Reset the doorbell to factory settings:** If the above steps don't resolve the issue, you can try resetting the doorbell to factory settings. To do this, press and hold the reset button on the back of the doorbell for 10 seconds. Once the doorbell has reset, you will need to re-configure it from scratch.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues with your Alarm.com video doorbell after trying these troubleshooting steps, please contact our office at 847-545-0101 or email us at repair@usprocom.com for further assistance."}],

The doorbell will emit a series of beeps and the LED light will flash.\n\n3. Once the doorbell has reset, release the reset button. The doorbell will restart and the LED light will turn solid blue.\n\n4. You will need to re-configure the doorbell from scratch. To do this, open the Alarm.com app on your smartphone or tablet and follow the prompts to add a new device.\n\n**Important note:** Resetting the doorbell to factory settings will erase all of your settings and recordings.
